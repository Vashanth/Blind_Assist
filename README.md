## Blind-Assist
React Native App  
To set up the React Native App environment we have to:
* install Android Studio
* install the Android SDK
* Configure the ANDROID_HOME environment variable
* Add platform-tools to Path
* To install all the dependencies we have to go to the root folder and call the command prompt from that directory and type 'npm install'  
* Then we have to connect the charging cable from phone to laptop
* Switch on USB debugging in Developer options in the phone
* Turn off MIUI optimisations if it is a Redmi phone
* To check whether the phone is connected and ready to install the app type 'adb devices' in the cmd and if our device is listed then connection is successful
* At first it will ask for a RSA configuration key acceptance, we have to allow in phone to start working
* To run the app in phone : we have to type 'react-native run-android' in cmd 
* This will open a node cmd where we can see the debugging screen and at first the process will be slow to install in phone, but later versions will install quicker

 ## Blind Assist v2 
 > Working directory :  Blind_Assist/Blind Assist v2/combo/
 
 In this version we have concentrated on transfer learning where we have retrained the mobilenet model to accomodate 3 classes. We have added 3 buttons to add 3 classes A,B and C respectively, we can target an object and take snapshots for corresponding classes by pressing the respective buttons, if we take 10-15 snaps of an object then it will start predicting class A,B and C correctly. In addition to predicting the 3 classes it parallely predicts the mobilenet pretrained classification and displays that in addition to this.  
   
 As this approach had to take snaps and deal with Document Object Model(DOM) in js, we had to make a website with js and html, then convert it into Progressive Web app(PWA) and convert the PWA to APK. We did not use React Native because it can't deal with DOM elements.
 
 To convert the website to PWA:
 * We have to add manifest.json file with main details about the app like app name and icon for the app and link it in html page
 * Next, we have to register a service worker
 * Weâ€™re using an async function for registering the ServiceWorker for easier to read code.
 * Ensure that the browser supports ServiceWorker before trying to register one.
 * Register the ServiceWorker with navigator.serviceWorker.register.
 * We can check these steps by opting for update on reload in Application tab in Developer tools
 * We can cache and serve static assets
 * To check whether cached content is served to the app, we have to go offline or opt for offline option in Application tab of Developer Tools

 We can Add to Home Screen and it will get installed as an app too.
