React Native App  
To set up the React Native App environment we have to:
* install Android Studio
* install the Android SDK
* Configure the ANDROID_HOME environment variable
* Add platform-tools to Path
* To install all the dependencies we have to go to the root folder and call the command prompt from that directory and type 'npm install'  
* Then we have to connect the charging cable from phone to laptop
* Switch on USB debugging in Developer options in the phone
* Turn off MIUI optimisations if it is a Redmi phone
* To check whether the phone is connected and ready to install the app type 'adb devices' in the cmd and if our device is listed then connection is successful
* At first it will ask for a RSA configuration key acceptance, we have to allow in phone to start working
* To run the app in phone : we have to type 'react-native run-android' in cmd 
* Thiss will open a node cmd where we can see the debugging screen and at first the process will be slow to install in phone, but later versions will install quicker
